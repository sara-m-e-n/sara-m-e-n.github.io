                    <p>Originally a school project, the aim was to build an optimized website with a framework. I used Foundation for that and I also worked with SASS for the styling. I also worked a lot with the image sizes and minification of the code in general.  </p>

                    <p>Originally a school project, the assignment was to build some form of application with Javascript. I wanted to create a harmonic rain effect. I was inspired by various mental health applications for distraction, and I would eventually like to convert the project to use canvas and make it interactive. </p>

The goal is to combine a lot of different resources and general tools and products, all sorted by category, to simplify the way we approach sustainability. </p>
