                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>I’m originally from Stockholm, Sweden, but I’ve now lived and worked in the UK for almost four years. <br/> <br/>
                
                    Back in 2015, I picked up web development as a hobby, and for the last year and a half I’ve been studying it remotely with a Swedish university. My main area of interest is front-end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I’m also really interested in design.</p>

                <h2>Technologies</h2>
                <p><u>Front-End</u> <br/> <br/>

                    I have a lot of experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition, I’m familiar with jQuery, SASS, and web frameworks such as Foundation. <br/> <br/>

                    <u>Back-End</u> <br/> <br/>

                    I’ve had some exposure to C# and .NET (using Visual Studio), as well as database technologies. <br/> <br/>

                    <u>Other</u> <br/> <br/>

                    I’ve done most of my programming in OS X but I also have some experience in Linux, which I have used via VirtualBox.<br/> <br/>

                    As part of my course, I’ve studied online security, UX-design, and digital graphics.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>My main experience has been my schoolwork so far, which has been very extensive and broad in terms of languages and technologies. <br/> <br/>

                    In my spare time, I’ve also worked on web projects such as this portfolio—originally designed in Adobe XD and converted into code. <br/> <br/>

                    Additionally, I’ve done some paid work for a friend that required changes to the layout of their website.</p>
